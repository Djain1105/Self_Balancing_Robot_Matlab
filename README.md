# Self_Balancing_Robot_Matlab

A self-balancing robot is a type of robot that can maintain its balance on two wheels without falling over. The self-balancing feature is achieved through the use of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller, which is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in control systems.

Components Used: Arduino Uno Microcontroller, L298N Motor Driver, MPU6050 Gyroscope, BO Motors, 2 Wheel Chassis, Wheels, 9V Batteries

Future Work Required: Using Model Reference Adaptive Control to make the system adjust the controller in real-time.
